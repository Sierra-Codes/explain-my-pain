# The Language of Endometriosis: A Taxonomy of Pain Descriptors

## Abstract  

Pain is frequently described through metaphorical language that conveys not only physical sensation but also emotional and social impact.  
This taxonomy captures recurring metaphorical frames in the discourse of patients with endometriosis, systematising them into categories such as *violent action*, *cutting tools*, *internal machinery*, and *birth labour*.  
Each category is anchored by a concise set of descriptors, drawn from patient narratives, and refined to remove duplication, ambiguity, and free-text variability.  

The taxonomy provides the linguistic backbone for the **Explain My Pain** app, which generates patient-friendly summaries and clinician-oriented notes.  
By standardising figurative descriptors of pain, it supports improved communication between patients and healthcare professionals, while preserving the expressive force of patient voices.  





This taxonomy underpins the **Explain My Pain** app.  
It categorises metaphorical frames patients use to describe pain, and standardises them into a set of clean, non-redundant expressions (no free text).

## Implications  

This taxonomy demonstrates how metaphor theory and applied linguistics can inform digital health tools.  
By giving patients a structured way to articulate their pain, and clinicians a consistent vocabulary for recognising symptom patterns, it bridges the gap between lived experience and medical communication.  

Future developments may extend this approach beyond endometriosis to other chronic conditions where figurative language plays a central role in describing invisible or hard-to-measure symptoms.
